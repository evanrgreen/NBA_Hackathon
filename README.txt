NBA Hackathon 2016
Members: Evan Green, Michael Menz, Kira Tebbe, and Luke Benz

In the inaugural NBA Hackathon, my team and I took the opportunity to analyze SportsVU tracking data and create a new metric for off-ball defense which had mostly been neglected by the current research. The metric was based on the sum of squared distances from each offensive player to the defender closer to him. We found that closer off-ball defense was related to more missed shots and fewer three points attempts. We also noted individual differences in an effort based on differences in on-ball and off-ball defense.
